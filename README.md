## Introduction

### Definition

World Model Econometrics (WME) is a Linear ECONOMETRIC Model of the Global Economy 

WME is open source and distributed with a liberal MIT licence

It is an interpretation of Post Keynesian Economics, The Solow Growth Model and Input Output Analysis trained on Annual Data

The MIT License, which bears the name of the famous university where it originated, is perhaps the most used open source license in the world, perhaps because it is very short and clear and easy to understand. It allows anyone to do whatever they wish with the original code, as long as the original copyright and license notice is included either in the distributed source code or software. It removes any liability from authors and does not explicitly contain a patent grant.

WME is delivered as a set of single page web apps. and engages with top ranked LLMs and data science providers.

### Methodology

MME Gathers Macro and Seven Sector production data on the major world economies and produces a coherent aggregate model.

Demand side is calculated using Keynesian principles and matched to the Solow capital model with flows calculated using the Leontief Input Output analysis.

Factors are calculated using Random Forest Regression and minimisation of loss functions. The components are represented as linear and log linear equations. The loss function is solved using the Guass Seidel Method.
